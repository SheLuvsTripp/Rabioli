This Privacy Policy explains how Rabioli collects and uses data while operating on Discord.

📋 What We Collect
We only collect the bare minimum needed to run the bot:

   - Server & Channel IDs
   - User IDs (used for moderation actions)
   - Command usage logs (e.g., command name and timestamp)
   - Server-specific settings (prefix, permissions, etc.)

We do NOT collect:

  -  Message content
  -  IP addresses
  -  Personally identifiable information

🛠️ How We Use Data
Collected data is used strictly for:

  -  Running bot commands
  -  Logging moderation actions (e.g., bans, kicks)
  -  Debugging and improving performance

We never sell, share, or disclose your data.

🗄️ Data Storage
-    Data is stored temporarily in-memory or securely in databases with restricted access.
-    Logs are cleared regularly and are not tied to user identities.
 -   If the bot is removed from your server, your server’s data is automatically deleted.

👤 Your Rights
You may:

  -  Remove the bot from your server at any time
 -  Request deletion of any stored data related to your server
  -  Contact us with any privacy concerns

🔐 Security
We prioritize your data’s safety. All data access is restricted, and our systems are monitored to prevent unauthorized access.

🔁 Changes
This policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of the bot means you accept the latest version.
